# My weekend project wpk-6

1. ### In a few sentences, explain the structure of your project .

    In this project, the first thing I did is I use map method to get all the items from the object. After that I specified the spicy food and the vegetarian food.

1. ### If you had more time, what area of your work would you improve?

   If I had more time I would have improve the card for the order because when I click the add button I only get the same thing with each button and more css style with the food list, the order and the modal.
1. ### Did you learn anything new while working on this project?

    I didn't really learn anything new but it is quite interesting how the map and the filter work.

1. ### What was the most challenging part for you?
    The most challenging part for me is to get the list to appear in the order and every time the user click add it's updated the price.

1. ### Would you like a new explanation about a specific topic?

    Yes definetly, I want more axplanation about how the reduce work to update the total price. And also when I checked both checkbox it doesn't work so I need some explanation on that.
